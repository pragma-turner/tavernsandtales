Hailing from a rural area of Batavia, Sixela is unused to the novel hustle and bustle of city life. 
She was inspired to go adventuring after a local farm hand, **Ferdinand**, filled her head with tales of fantastic creatures.
She is naturally good with woodland animals, and has an affinity for the common-folk.
