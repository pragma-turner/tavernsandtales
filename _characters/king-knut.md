I, King Knut of clan Fjordskala, am the rightful ruler of the Drakkar Isles, lord of the Havserpents and the first scales, defender of the faith, and protector of the clutch. I have come to the Gold Coast to raise an army and reclaim my throne from the treacherous Kiwi, the usurper and defiler of the maw. I will stop at nothing to reclaim what is rightfully mine, and I promise to enrich my adherents beyond their wildest dreams in return for their service.

What’s that? You don’t want to recite all these titles every time you refer to me? Hmm…. I suppose you could just call me ‘your scaliness’ or something like that.
