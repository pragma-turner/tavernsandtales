    <h1>Collaborative Narrative Cinematic Fantasy</h1>

    <p>
      Thanks for signing up for D&D at Austin Beerworks Sprinkle Valley! We are three D&D players and DMs that wanted to bring a collaborative Dungeons & Dragons experience to Austin Beerworks that is focused on building a narrative with our players. Our games will all take place at the same time and rough location in the game world, and there will be opportunities for the tables to shape the world around them and interact with each other at key moments.
    </p>

    <p>
      If youve never played D&D, this is your chance! We welcome new players, just bring your imagination and an open mind, and we'll cover the rest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our focus is going to be on narrative, so our games will not typically use maps or minis. No need to lug a bunch of equipment to play!
    </p>

    <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
    <p>An open mind and an active imagination! We will supply pre-made character sheets for all standard classes, pencils, and dice.</p>
