# The Giant F'ing Frog
Heimer, Grizz, Fen, and Silexa all find themselves recovering from their travels across the Great Sea at a Goldspire hole-in-the-wall called The Crow's Eye. They encounter a kobold named Dresden, who has had a few drinks at the bar after returning his wedding attire to Aubergine's Awakened Atelier. After introductions, the party is interrupted by a drunken dwarf, who accidentally splashes his drink towards the party, only soaking Grizz.

The dwarf (let's call him Drinky), begins incoherently mumbling at the party. They are able to successfully interpret that he would like them to buy him another drink -- preferably from one of the wine-stalls at the Autumn-Fair taking place in the market square outside. There is some hemming and hawing, but Silexa finally takes the initiative and leads Drinky to a nearby stall. Silexa chats up the spiced-wine saleswoman, Linda, and gets a free drink after regaling her with tales of her Folk-Hero background. Unfortunately at this point Drinky has passed out, and never receives the drink he was intent on getting.

Meanwhile, Grizz notices a jester manning a dunk-a-punk station nearby, and decides to have a go at it. He realizes that the ball he is given is rigged, but decides to take a shot anyway. The ball goes wide, and the jester blows a raspberry at him while calling him unprintable names. Dresden steps up to take a shot, but uses his dagger instead of the rigged ball, hitting the bullseye and dunking the annoying jester.

Off to the side, Heimer realizes that a couple of street-urchins are busy running a con on a well-off seeming merchant. One of the urchins plays injured, and the other lifts the man's bill-fold. Heimer manages to successfully use his mage-hand to pull the bills out of the bill-fold without alerting the urchin, and pockets the change.

Eventually, the party notices a mangy half-elf who has been locked in a pillory. He calls them over, and introduces himself as Scral Luz. He tells Fen that he knows where treasure is buried, and is willing to lead the adventurers there if they break him out. The party is incredibly suspicious of Scral (who they nickname Cleetus), but decide to try to break him free. Unfortunately Fen's lock-pick breaks off in the padlock with a loud metallic snap, alerting some nearby guards.

Dresden tries to distract the guards by playing drunk, claiming he is about to have a bout of incontinence, while at the same time Silexa casts speak with animals to try and improve her ability to speak with the guards. While Silexa is technically correct that humanoids are a type of animal, this does not help her at all with speaking the common tongue, and she is unable to waylay the guards. Luckily, Fen starts shouting and accusing Cleetus of grabbing her before the guards can see that she was trying to pick the lock.

The guard gives Scral/Cleetus a few smacks, and asks Fen what she would like to do with the knave. Fen immediately suggests that the guard release Cleetus into her command so that she can dole out some of her own justice. The guard loves this idea, and handcuffs Cleetus. He asks Fen to return the criminal in 15 minutes, and to give him a wallop for him.

Of course, the party does no such thing, and immediately makes their way to The Mistwood forest. After being threatened by the druid Silexa, who nearly drowns him, Cleetus confirms that the party is headed in the right direction. They quickly find a dilapidated temple on the far side of a lake, in which sit several large boulders.

Grizz recognizes that the largest of the boulders is actually a giant frog, and Silexa uses her speak with animals spell talk to the frog. The frog declares her Queen of the forest, before asking if he can eat some of the beasts she travels with. Silexa gives the frog permission to eat Cleetus, but only after they find the treasure. The frog indicates that several humans entered the temple some time ago, and have not come out since. The party deduces that the treasure must be in the temple.

They approach the temple, and solve a riddle inscribed on the entrance to determine that they must hunt a beast in order to open the temple door. Unfortunately, while solving the riddle Cleetus manages to sneak away. They find and kill a fox, which is not quite the beast that the door requested, but the door opens enough for the two smallest members of the party, Fen and Heimer, to squeeze into the temple.

They discover that Cleetus, after escaping, has climbed the roof of the temple and is dangling from a hole in the ceiling with his hands still bound. They shoot him down from the ceiling, into a trap created by Heimer, but before they can interrogate him the giant frog decides he has had enough waiting, and tries to eat Grizz.
