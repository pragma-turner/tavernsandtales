# The Giant F'ing Frog <a name="giant-frog"></a>
**Heimer**, **Grizz**, **Fen**, and **Silexa** all find themselves recovering from their travels across the Great Sea at a Goldspire hole-in-the-wall called The Crow's Eye. They encounter a kobold named **Dresden**, who has had a few drinks at the bar after returning his wedding attire to Aubergine's Awakened Atelier. After introductions, the party is interrupted by a drunken dwarf, who accidentally splashes his drink towards the party, only soaking **Grizz**.

The dwarf (let's call him Drinky), begins incoherently mumbling at the party. They are able to successfully interpret that he would like them to buy him another drink -- preferably from one of the wine-stalls at the Autumn-Fair taking place in the market square outside. There is some hemming and hawing, but **Silexa**  finally takes the initiative and leads Drinky to a nearby stall. **Silexa**  chats up the spiced-wine saleswoman, Linda, and gets a free drink after regaling her with tales of her Folk-Hero background. Unfortunately at this point Drinky has passed out, and never receives the drink he was intent on getting.

Meanwhile, **Grizz** notices a jester manning a dunk-a-punk station nearby, and decides to have a go at it. He realizes that the ball he is given is rigged, but decides to take a shot anyway. The ball goes wide, and the jester blows a raspberry at him while calling him unprintable names. **Dresden** steps up to take a shot, but uses his dagger instead of the rigged ball, hitting the bullseye and dunking the annoying jester.

Off to the side, **Heimer** realizes that a couple of street-urchins are busy running a con on a well-off seeming merchant. One of the urchins plays injured, and the other lifts the man's bill-fold. **Heimer** manages to successfully use his mage-hand to pull the bills out of the bill-fold without alerting the urchin, and pockets the change.

Eventually, the party notices a mangy half-elf who has been locked in a pillory. He calls them over, and introduces himself as Scral Luz. He tells **Fen** that he knows where treasure is buried, and is willing to lead the adventurers there if they break him out. The party is incredibly suspicious of Scral (who they nickname Cleetus), but decide to try to break him free. Unfortunately **Fen**'s lock-pick breaks off in the padlock with a loud metallic snap, alerting some nearby guards.

**Dresden** tries to distract the guards by playing drunk, claiming he is about to have a bout of incontinence, while at the same time **Silexa**  casts speak with animals to try and improve her ability to speak with the guards. While **Silexa**  is technically correct that humanoids are a type of animal, this does not help her at all with speaking the common tongue, and she is unable to waylay the guards. Luckily, **Fen** starts shouting and accusing Cleetus of grabbing her before the guards can see that she was trying to pick the lock.

The guard gives Scral/Cleetus a few smacks, and asks **Fen** what she would like to do with the knave. **Fen** immediately suggests that the guard release Cleetus into her command so that she can dole out some of her own justice. The guard loves this idea, and handcuffs Cleetus. He asks **Fen** to return the criminal in 15 minutes, and to give him a wallop for him.

Of course, the party does no such thing, and immediately makes their way to The Mistwood forest. After being threatened by the druid **Silexa** , who nearly drowns him, Cleetus confirms that the party is headed in the right direction. They quickly find a dilapidated temple on the far side of a lake, in which sit several large boulders.

**Grizz** recognizes that the largest of the boulders is actually a giant frog, and **Silexa**  uses her speak with animals spell talk to the frog. The frog declares her Queen of the forest, before asking if he can eat some of the beasts she travels with. **Silexa**  gives the frog permission to eat Cleetus, but only after they find the treasure. The frog indicates that several humans entered the temple some time ago, and have not come out since. The party deduces that the treasure must be in the temple.

They approach the temple, and solve a riddle inscribed on the entrance to determine that they must hunt a beast in order to open the temple door. Unfortunately, while solving the riddle Cleetus manages to sneak away. They find and kill a fox, which is not quite the beast that the door requested, but the door opens enough for the two smallest members of the party, **Fen** and **Heimer**, to squeeze into the temple.

They discover that Cleetus, after escaping, has climbed the roof of the temple and is dangling from a hole in the ceiling with his hands still bound. They shoot him down from the ceiling, into a trap created by **Heimer**, but before they can interrogate him the giant frog decides he has had enough waiting, and tries to eat **Grizz**.

# The Mountains <a name="the-mountain"></a>
After dealing with the death of their guide Stallenor, the big group splits and one party follows Jemwise into the Underdark, while our party follows Princess Lukith up into the Wolf's Teeth Mountains. Some gear is distributed from Stallenor and our new party forms. **Hasselhoff** the Lore Bard, **Hulnir** the Sorceress, **Geo** the Rune Knight, **Uhr** the Dao Warlock, and **Luvon** the Wildfire Druid.

**Geo** quickly takes the lead and begins scouting up the trail for more signs from Princess Lukith, and while the party is able to follow a trail the journey is difficult. Brush, mud, and the mundane travails of the wilderness beleaguer the newly formed group.

Several hours later and nearing sunset the party sees a tall rock plinth jutting through the trees ahead. Choosing to investigate, they find a 60 foot tall massive plinth of rock jutting from the ground, and roughly shaped into a tall tapering pillar. The base of the pillar is some 20 feet across, and a 40ft circle of cleared ground sits well used in front of it.  The top of the pillar has a narrow vertical slit some 15 feet long, and at the base of the divide, a round hole is bored through the stone. 20 feet up the pillar large runes in Giant say "Overthinking".

The party takes their time and after some careful thought and maneuvering is able to find that if viewed from the right angle, the setting sun will pass through the keyhole and seem to fall into a slot between two peaks in the mountains above. They wait briefly, and enjoy the moment.

Sensing the urgency of their pursuit the party picks back up the trail and skips any attempt at rest to try and catch their quarry. Still led by **Geo**, the party soon stumbles into a dark glade. Fortunately, **Geo** is able to spot a massive bear trap well hidden in the lush grass just before he steps in it. Sensing a dangerous situation and with **Luvon** and Urh lacking the ability to see in the dark, the party lines up single-file and attempts to quietly cross the glade. **Geo** is able to spot some more of the traps, but not before setting one off with his foot. With help from his new friends **Geo** is freed and manages to capture two of these giant traps from the glade. Upon exiting the other side, the party quickly finds the remains of the unlucky hunter(?) who once mainteded these traps. With the trap setting tool and two of the traps in hand, Urh makes a quick jaunt into his genies vessel to store the massive traps.

With multiple members of the party now exhausted, they decide to sleep while **Geo** forges ahead looking for more subtle signs of Lukith's passing. Unfortunately, **Geo** spends all of the long rest working fruitlessly. **Luvon** is quick to point out that under the light of The Sun, all is revealed, and lo the trail sign was found. (Praise be).

Renewed, the party rushes on but as the trail gains elevation they can hear loud sounds of moaning up ahead. **Uhr** scouts out the sounds and discovers a massive and ancient looking Hill Giant reclined painfully against a small stone outcropping a tight bend in a trail leading higher into the mountains. The giant is covered in small wounds but and looks pained, but is most obviously pained by the tendrils of oily black that spread up his body from a wound on his leg. A broken tree clutch in one hand, and broken stones from the outcropping he rests against in his left, the giant is surrounded by bodies of fallen Xerakath's Blades.

The Giant calls out to **Uhr**, beckoning him closer. **Uhr**, curious, goes to talk with this dying giant. As they do the rest of the party is spotted by a swoop of swallows that quickly fly to the giant and seem to whisper in his ear. **Uhr** is able to convince the giant that they share similar goals in regards to the Blades and as the giant dies, he reveals his name and offers a token to protect them from "our friends" and to let his kin know their friendly status. As the giant finally succumbs to the poison, he utters his name. "Thrum".

As the giant dies, massive dire wolves bolt from the tree line, their dangerous prey now finally dead. The 5 massive wolves are met with more resistance than they anticipated as **Geo** grows in size and **Uhr** and **Luvon** begin to release deadly magic. **Hasselhoff** is unfortunately almost laid low right off the bat as two wolves are able to attack him. Seeing **Hasselhoff** in trouble, the rest of the party is able to come to his aid.

**Luvon** uses a new magic idol of a fire snake to summon one in front of the wolves as they attempt to clear the trees, while **Geo** starts making quick work of one of the wolves. **Uhr** seeing an opportunity, casts Spike growth in the area the wolves will have to move through. As predicted, the wolves begin to grind themselves to paste attempting to leave the area. **Uhr** is pleased.

As the battle seems to be turning, twin roars are heard from the trees as a massive Ettin bursts forth. The Ettin emerges just in time to see a dire wolf grate itself to death through a field of barely visible spikes, and makes a long trip to the side, clambering up a small rock wall onto the higher portion of the trail. **Hulnir** wastes no time and casts Grease just as the Ettin finishes its brief climb and it fins itself prone and unable to rise. With two wolves and a greasy Ettin left, the party takes stock and prepares for their next move.
