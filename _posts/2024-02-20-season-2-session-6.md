### Troll Roast

In the midst of a battle with a troll, covered in massive blood sucking insects and roaring, grease fed flames, **Geo**, **Hasselhoff**, **Uhr**, and **Luvon** scramble for position in large roughly circular cave. Lit only by the flames licking at the trolls flesh, the party continues pouring fire on the troll, and **Uhr** sets up a spike growth field right behind **Geo** and the troll. The foot and half long giant insects not yet killed by the fire launch into the air and quickly try and attack the new warm bodies in the room. Luckily they are unable to do much to **Geo**, **Luvon**, and **Hasselhoff**.

The troll finally awake and in range of a threat, approaches and attacks **Geo**, and with two swipes of it's massive claws nearly lays **Geo** out. But as the troll ends his last swipe, a rune carved on **Geo**'s shield blasts out with light, striking the troll and forcing it into a stupefied state. Nira takes the opportunity to take a devastating sneak attack with her short bow, nailing the troll at the point between shoulder and neck. **Geo**, seeing the arrow strike then sees *his* opportunity, and swings once, missing and decides to make use of the field of magical spikes carpeting the floor behind him. Using his runic magic, **Geo** grows nearly as large as the troll, and grapples it. Quickly spinning around, **Geo** drags the troll across the spikes, shredding it's lower extremities.

**Hasselhoff** is able to heal up **Geo** a bit, and crush a Stirge affixed to his shoulder by ramming himself and it into a nearby wall, but is soon distracted as a massive jumble of limbs rolls into the back of the cave room and bumps into Nira, flailing against her and injuring her gravely. It appears the troll seeded the pikes of body parts outside its cave with it's own discarded, but slowly regenerating limbs, as a makeshift trap. **Luvon** is able to use Burning Hands to blast both the Stirge attached to his body, as well as the Troll, still stupefied and stuck in a grapple by **Geo**. **Luvon** shouts a command and a bright, animate shard of light coheres against the back wall of the cavern. **Luvon** has summoned his companion Sol. Just in time, for at this moment another jumble of limbs rolls into the mouth of the cave and assaults Nira anew. **Luvon** is able to move to her aid, but Nira is looking bad.

**Geo** still tightly gripping a troll covered in flames, grimaces through the burning pain, and drags the troll around the perimeter of the field of magical spikes that **Uhr** put in place, fully grinding the trolls lower legs to pulp. **Hasselhoff** flicks a dagger out of his brace, and as it flies across the room towards a Limbjumble it grows and splits becoming a cloud of daggers swirling and slicing at the terrifying collection of body parts. **Uhr** senses the time is right to stike at the troll and with one final blast of energy is able to shove it out of **Geo**'s grip and impale its head upon a particularly large spike. The biggest threat felled, (but still aflame) the party is able to quickly mop up the remaining Limbjumbles and Stirges.

After a disgusting process of finding all the remaining troll bits and feeding them to the fire, the party is able to scour the cave complex for any valuables, and finds : 1 pair of fine leather boots that are remarkably clean, a shield with an emblem of two arrows crossed on the front, a small gold ring with a red ruby in it, a floppy grey forage cap with a small emblem of a rat on the front, a simple grey canvas sack roughly 2 feet long with a leather draw string stop, and a surprisingly sturdy stick that appears to have been severely burned, roughly a foot long.

While exploring the cave, the party is able to spot a hidden door behind the Troll's bedding and with some work open it. Behind the door, a hallway of worked stone extends deeper into the mountain. After surpassing a pit trap in the hallway, they find a beautifully bas relief bronze door depicting a group of 12 dwarves battling a stone giant. Runes in Dwarvish across the top of the Door say "Unyielding as the stone." In the center of the door, one of the dwarf's shields is revealed to be a knob. **Geo** attempts to open the door with the knob and is promptly stabbed in the palm with a hidden needle. Poisoned and falling to the ground paralyzed **Geo** urges his party on. Unfazed the rest of the group finds a small room with two sarcophagi and an alter. On the alter, more Dwarvish runes "Timbeck and Fulgrin Stonehammer lie here. They gave their lives so that we might live. Jomar guide them to the halls."

**Hasselhoff** summons an unseen servant and uses it to push open the two sarcophagi, finding bones and the dusty remnants of a hammer and pick in each. But, hidden among the dust at the foot of each is a last gift to the fallen. Inside Timbeck's sarcophagus , a glass bottle with amber colored fluid inside and a note: "To ensure you can always *slip out* and find your way to a proper pint".  Inside Fulgrin's, a small red box with a simple latch on the front. "No need to chase it anymore Fulgrin, the dragon comes to you."
