The party wakes up in the Goblin warren surrounded by the stink of goblin children. Their host, Glub-glub, had allowed them to stay in his home for free, but there was only room in his nursery nest. As it so happens, all of the party members are heavy sleepers and they all wake up fully refreshed. The leader of the goblin gang, Skab, reminds the party that they are to seek out Balphagore, Lore of Chains (aka Balphy) who was abducted by Kymarians during a raid. Defenders of the warren overheard the Kymarians mention the Mistwood Monarch, which [Sixela]({% link _characters/sixela.md %}) identifies as a giant edelwood tree in the Southern Mistwood forest.

Before leaving town, the party heads to Stoutheart's Apiary which sits above Flameclaw Flabreads. The proprietor of the flatbread shop, Pete Zah IX, gives the party a quest to find an ancient family recipe housed in a Volic temple somewhere on the Golden Coast surrounded by trees that sprout multi-faceted yellow fruits with green leafy tops. Various family texts hotly debate whether the recipe is cursed or holds the secret to flatbread bliss.

After receiving this strange request, the party stops by Stoutheart's where they learn that their recently evolved Bumble-zilla pupa can be sustained by either slathering it in royal jelly, feeding it magic, or bathing it in blood. They purchase more royal jelly.

### On the Road Again

Finally on the road, the party heads south following the natural bends of the Grishdog river. On their second day of travel a heavy downpour starts, chilling them to their bones. They round a bend in the road, and spot a troupe of travelers who are resting around a large box. 

[Sixela]({% link _characters/sixela.md %}) strikes up a conversation with an impressionable young member of the group, Finn, and learns that the group knows the location of Balphy before Jaren, the group leader, can shut Finn up. Meanwhile, **Fen** hears growling coming from the large box, and spots a couple of heavily armed members of the group. Using his new psychic messaging powers, **Fen** coordinates with [Sixela]({% link _characters/sixela.md %}) and **Grizz** to hatch a new plan. **Grizz** and **Fen** approach the party and fool Jaren into thinking that they are, in fact, reinforcements from town. [Sixela]({% link _characters/sixela.md %}) asks if she can accompany the band back to town, where she can hopefully find more information about Balphy, and Jaren agrees on the condition that she leaves the impressionable young Finn alone.

After making camp, **Fen** manages to draw the short-straw for first watch. While everyone is asleep, he and [Sixela]({% link _characters/sixela.md %}) determine that there is a very grumpy Displacer Beast inside of the large box. **Fen** tries to undo the locks on the box, but wakes up a few members of the group who raise the alarm. A brawl ensues, and **Fen** barely manages to escape getting turned into minced-meat by teleporting to **Grizz**, who looses a volley of arrows at Jaren protecting the party's retreat. Just as **Fen** teleports to **Grizz**, a few of the underlings in the party undo the last of the locks on the box, hoping that the beast inside will chase down the party members...
